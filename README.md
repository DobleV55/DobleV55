- 👋 Hi, I’m @DobleV55
- 👀 I’m interested in the Backend projects and how to make better, readable, and simpler code. Always learning how CI/CD's are implemented, and how to do them. How to create a more agile, robust, and secure code. Learning more about agile methodologies as SCRUM, and learning new Cloud services tools from AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Provider) like Lambdas, API Gateways, AMI, Cloud Storage, etc. In addition, a Python and Go self-learner and motivated project creator.. Backend is my passion <3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **DS&A** and developing for **Open Source projects**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects or Start-ups.
